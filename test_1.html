  <p>This will be about the mechanics of the game. Powders, sand and gravel have gravity. Other blocks can float in the air. Those blocks will just fall so be careful when bridging. Sometimes when you kill a mob (or entity) they will drop stuff. A Creeper will drop gunpowder and a Zombie will drop rotten flesh. All mobs will drop XP when killed. You can explore more about what mobs drop what in the crafting section.</p>
