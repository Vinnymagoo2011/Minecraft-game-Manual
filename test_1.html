  <p>This will be about the mechanics of the game. Powders, sand and gravel have gravity. Other blocks can float in the air. Those blocks will just fall so be careful when bridging. Sometimes when you kill a mob (or entity) they will drop stuff. A Creeper will drop gunpowder and a Zombie will drop rotten flesh. All mobs will drop XP when killed. You can explore more about mob drops what in the crafting section. Now about generation. Ores will generate underground. When you mine the ores you get the drops. You can only mine iron with a stone+ pickaxe and redstone and more with an iron+ pickaxe. You can mine stone (and other minerals) and coal ore with a wooden pickaxes.
